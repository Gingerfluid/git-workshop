## What is GIT?

DVCS - Distributed Version Control System

Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

* Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. 
* Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. 
* It is used by most major technology companies. 
* It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud native computing.

## Github Markdown
For making your README files and other informational files look pretty, you can use the built in markdown language.
Here's a couple of basics

For **Bold** text use `** your text **` or `__ your text __`   

For *Italics* text use `* your text *` or `_ your text _`  

For ~~Strike-though~~ use `~~ your text ~~`  

For a bullet-point list use `* list item`  

For a numbered list use `1. list item`   

For inline links wrap link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrap the URL in parentheses `( )`.   
eg `[your link text]` `(https://your.link.com/)`

Headings use a preceding `#` before your text.  The more hashes you add, the smaller the heading.  
eg `# your text` would be the largest heading 
`###### your text` would be the smallest heading 

To enbed an image like the logo on this page, use `![alternate text](https://your-link-to-an-image.png)`  
If your logo is in the root directory of your repo, you can simply use `![alternate text](image.png)`

### Tables
